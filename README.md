This repository contains the codes I used in my doctoral thesis.

I would like to give credit for my version of the Fiberscore algorithm to Robert Pham, from whom I took the first version I started from.
I would also like to give credit to Constantino Carlos Reyes-Aldasoro from whom I took the first form of the wound-healing assay code.

I thank them for their inspiration and contribution.
